This is a non-blocking (no use of delay) LCD library for use with sparkfun displays that use SerLCD library.  
Tested on Arduino UNO R4 qith qwiic cable on wire1 with a sparkfun 20x4.
Credits mostly to Claude.ai for writing most of the code.

See example, SerLCD0_Test.ino and serlcd0-user-guide.md for info.
